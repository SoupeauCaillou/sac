You'll need to install the following packages to use the SAC engine.

Available from repository:
	Necessary:
		cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libvorbis-dev libvpx-dev libtinyxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev libsdl-dev libopenal-dev libglew-dev
		g++ OR clang++
	Not necessary:
		libunittest++-dev
Not available in repository:
	AntTweakBar(1)

cmake: used to generate build files
g++ OR clang++: any c++ compiler supporting C++11 features
libcurl4-openssl-dev: used by the WWWCurlAPI to download file from WWW from within a game.
libgl1-mesa-dev: used for rendering
libglew-dev: used for rendering
libvpx-dev: used by the recorder (converting screen activity to a movie file, for doing a trailer or...)
libtinyxml2: used by the localizationAPI, to parse the XML files where strings are localized (we are using file used by Android platform)
libsqlite3-dev: used by the sqliteStorageAPI to store data in a database
libsdl-dev: library used for managing the window and inputs (keyboard / mouse / joystick)
libopenal-dev: used for playing sounds/musics
libvorbis-dev: used for playing sounds/musics 
AntTweakBar: a graphical interface to help us debug the game from within it. It is available at anttweakbar.sourceforge.net
libunittest++-dev: used to do unit tests on systems / parts of the engine

(1) To install Ant Tweak Bar (or any third party library):
	(a) Download it from site
	(b) Compile it. Go into the src/ directory, type make
	(c) Then you have 3 choices. To tell cmake where the library is located, you can:
		(i) put it in heriswap/../sac_libs_dep/AntTweakBar
		or
		(ii) set environment variable SAC_LIBS_DIR to the folder containing the different libraries
		(iii) set environment variable ANTTWEAKBARDIR to the path of the folder

For Android build, you will also need:
	Available from repository:
		Necessary:
			ant default-jdk
	ant: used for building Android project 
	default-jdk or any JDK: because we are developing Java stuff ;-)

	Set ANDROID_NDK environment variable to the path you installed it. (https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)
	Add to your PATH environement variable the location of:
		- ndk-build (ANDROID_NDK)
		- android (ANDROID_HOME/tools)
		- adb (ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools)
